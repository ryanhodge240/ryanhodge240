# Greetings!!
Hello, my name is Ryan Hodge and I have a background in web development and ROS (the robot operating system). 
I am very interested in web design as well as any sort of programming such as game dev, programming raspberry pis,
or even constructing different robots. 
I am a student at Temple University and majoring in both computer science and electrical engineering. 
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about anything at all!

You can reach me at ryanhodge240@gmail.com and will soon be able to reach me through my website at [ryanhdoge.net]()
